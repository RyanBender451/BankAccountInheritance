Program made by Ryan Bender
---------------------------
This program is a simple account simulator.
The program uses do-while loops to go through the main and subclass menus.  
The base class is just used for getting the name and base account number.
The 3 child classes work exactly the same.  They mainly get their specific number (orginial account number with a 2 letter account identifier code: RA, CA, SA).  
Each child class can add and subtract money from the account, the account cannot go below zero, but it can hit zero.  
Each child class has 4 option
1) add money
2) subtract money
3) display amount and transactions
4) print reciept and quit - this is the streamwriter option that puts the transaction information into the txt file. 
each add and subtract use does print out the amount on the screen for a couple of seconds so the user can get a quick look.
the 3 option displays it for 3 seconds.
and when you quit the program it thanks you for using the terminal.
